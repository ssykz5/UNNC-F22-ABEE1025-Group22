## 1. Background and motivation of this software
    It is always difficult for us to analyze and visualize data, especially if there is a large amount of it. Data cleaning and visualizing always consume lots of time and irritate us a lot.

    This software is designed for analyzing and visualizing data with graphic user interface, especially for indoor temperature analyzing. The idea is coming up when we try to analyse data of CSET and PMB building from Building Performance Report coursework.
## 2. Key functions of this software
    After importing a excel or csv file, it can help you do the data cleaning (drop useless rows and columns). Additionaly, it can help you calculate the mean value. Then, it can be used to draw graphs to visialize data. If the data contains indoor temperature, it can give you the results compared with the recommended values from CIBSE Guide.
